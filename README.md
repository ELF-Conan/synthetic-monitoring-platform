# Synthetic Monitoring Platform

The Synthetic Monitoring Platform is a comprehensive solution designed to monitor network and application performance using synthetic transactions. It leverages Python, Prometheus for time series database management, and Grafana for insightful visualizations. This platform utilizes the PingParsing library to perform efficient ping operations, ensuring high availability and performance of your services.

## Features

- **Ping Monitoring**: Utilizes the PingParsing library for accurate and detailed ICMP echo request analyses.
- **Time Series Data Storage**: Integrates with Prometheus for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of monitoring data over time.
- **Visual Insights**: Employs Grafana for customizable and insightful visualization of monitoring data, aiding in quick decision-making.
- **Configurable Monitoring**: Supports customization and configuration for different environments and requirements.
